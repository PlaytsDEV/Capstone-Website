# Legacy Folder

This folder contains old files that are kept to avoid breaking existing imports during the migration period.

## Contents

- `components/Footer.jsx` - Old Footer component (use `shared/components/Footer.jsx` instead)

## Note

These files will be removed in a future cleanup once all references are updated.
