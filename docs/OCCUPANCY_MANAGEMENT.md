# Room, Bed & Occupancy Management System

## Overview

The Room, Bed & Occupancy Management module tracks and manages room capacity, bed assignments, and occupancy rates across all dormitory branches. It provides real-time occupancy data and automatically manages room availability based on confirmed reservations.

## Key Features

### 1. Room Configuration

- **Capacity Management**: Each room has a defined capacity (1 for private, 2 for double-sharing, 4 for quadruple-sharing)
- **Bed Tracking**: Individual bed management with position tracking (upper, lower, single)
- **Availability Flags**: Automatic availability calculation based on current occupancy
- **Branch Assignment**: Rooms assigned to specific branches (Gil Puyat, Guadalupe)

### 2. Bed Management

Each bed in a room has the following structure:

```javascript
{
  id: String,                  // Unique bed identifier
  position: String,            // "upper", "lower", or "single"
  available: Boolean,          // Availability status
  occupiedBy: {
    userId: ObjectId,          // User occupying the bed
    reservationId: ObjectId,   // Associated reservation
    occupiedSince: Date        // When the bed was occupied
  }
}
```

### 3. Occupancy Tracking

- **Automatic Updates**: Occupancy automatically updates when reservation status changes
- **Status-Based Occupancy**:
  - `pending` → No occupancy impact
  - `confirmed` → Room marked as occupied (+1 to currentOccupancy)
  - `checked-in` → Room remains occupied (no additional change)
  - `cancelled` → Occupancy released (-1 to currentOccupancy)
  - `checked-out` → Occupancy released (-1 to currentOccupancy)

## Data Models

### Room Model Enhancements

```javascript
{
  capacity: Number,                    // Max occupants
  currentOccupancy: Number,            // Current number of occupants
  available: Boolean,                  // Availability status
  beds: [{                             // Individual bed tracking
    id: String,
    position: String,
    available: Boolean,
    occupiedBy: {
      userId: ObjectId,
      reservationId: ObjectId,
      occupiedSince: Date
    }
  }],
  // Virtual fields
  isFull: Boolean,                     // currentOccupancy >= capacity
  availableSlots: Number               // capacity - currentOccupancy
}
```

### Room Methods

- `occupyBed(bedId, userId, reservationId)` - Mark a bed as occupied
- `vacateBed(bedId)` - Mark a bed as vacant
- `getAvailableBeds()` - Get list of unoccupied beds
- `getOccupiedBeds()` - Get list of occupied beds
- `isBedAvailable(bedId)` - Check if specific bed is available
- `increaseOccupancy()` - Increment current occupancy
- `decreaseOccupancy()` - Decrement current occupancy
- `updateAvailability()` - Recalculate room availability

### Reservation Model Enhancements

New methods for occupancy tracking:

- `countsTowardOccupancy()` - Check if reservation affects room capacity
- `getOccupancyStatus()` - Get occupancy information

## Occupancy Manager Utility

### Core Functions

#### `updateOccupancyOnReservationChange(reservation, oldData)`

Handles occupancy updates when reservation status changes.

- **Increases Occupancy**: When status becomes "confirmed" or "checked-in"
- **Decreases Occupancy**: When status becomes "cancelled" or "checked-out"
- **Bed Management**: Assigns/vacates beds based on selectedBed
- **Room Availability**: Automatically recalculates room availability

#### `recalculateRoomOccupancy(roomId)`

Recalculates occupancy from scratch by counting confirmed/checked-in reservations.
**Use Case**: Data recovery, consistency checks

#### `getRoomOccupancyStatus(roomId)`

Provides detailed occupancy information for a specific room including:

- Occupancy rate percentage
- List of occupied beds with resident info
- List of available beds
- Current vs. maximum capacity

#### `getBranchOccupancyStats(branch)`

Provides comprehensive occupancy statistics for entire branch.
**Optional Parameter**: `branch` - Leave empty for all branches

## Workflow Examples

### Example 1: New Reservation Confirmed

```
User creates reservation (status: pending)
  ↓
Admin verifies payment & confirms (status: confirmed)
  ↓
updateOccupancyOnReservationChange triggered
  ↓
Room occupancy increases by 1
  ↓
Bed marked as occupied
  ↓
Room availability recalculated
```

### Example 2: Tenant Check-In

```
Tenant performs check-in (status: checked-in)
  ↓
updateOccupancyOnReservationChange triggered
  ↓
No occupancy change (already counted from confirmation)
  ↓
User role updated to "tenant"
  ↓
tenantStatus set to "active"
```

### Example 3: Reservation Cancellation

```
User or admin cancels reservation
  ↓
updateOccupancyOnReservationChange triggered
  ↓
Room occupancy decreases by 1
  ↓
Bed marked as available
  ↓
Room availability updated to available again
```

## Database Indexes

The following indexes are configured for optimal occupancy queries:

- `roomId, checkInDate` - For finding reservations by room and date
- `status, checkInDate` - For finding reservations by status and date
- `userId, status` - For finding user's reservations by status

## Business Rules

### Occupancy Counting Rules

1. **Only Confirmed & Checked-In Count**: Only reservations with status "confirmed" or "checked-in" count toward room occupancy
2. **Archived Don't Count**: Archived reservations never count toward occupancy
3. **Automatic Availability**: `available` flag automatically set to `true` when occupancy < capacity
4. **Full Room Status**: `isFull` virtual indicates when room reaches capacity

### Bed Assignment Rules

1. **One Occupant Per Bed**: Each bed can only be occupied by one reservation
2. **Tracked from Confirmation**: Beds are assigned when reservation status becomes "confirmed"
3. **Automatic Vacancy**: Beds automatically released when reservation is cancelled or checked-out
4. **Optional Selection**: selectedBed is optional - rooms without beds assigned for quarantine rooms

## Error Handling

The system includes graceful error handling:

- **Non-Fatal Occupancy Failures**: Occupancy update failures don't block reservation updates (logged as warnings)
- **Atomic Operations**: Each occupancy change is saved together with room data
- **Validation**: Input validation on room IDs and branch filters

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Recalculation Utility

If occupancy data becomes inconsistent, use:

```javascript
import { recalculateRoomOccupancy } from "./utils/occupancyManager.js";

// Recalculate single room
await recalculateRoomOccupancy(roomId);

// Or check entire branch stats
import { getBranchOccupancyStats } from "./utils/occupancyManager.js";
const stats = await getBranchOccupancyStats("gil-puyat");
```

### Logging

All occupancy changes are logged with:

- Room name and ID
- Occupancy change (increase/decrease)
- Bed assignments/vacancies
- Previous and new occupancy counts

## Integration with Existing Modules

### Reservation Management

- `updateReservation()`: Triggers occupancy on status change
- `deleteReservation()`: Releases occupancy when deleted
- `archiveReservation()`: Cancels reservation first to release occupancy

### User Management

- Tenant status automatically activated on check-in
- Role updated to "tenant" when checked-in

### Room Management

- Room availability automatically recalculated
- Used in availability checking for room selection

## Future Enhancements

Potential features for future implementation:

1. **Occupancy Forecasting**: Predict future occupancy based on pending reservations
2. **Peak Hours Analysis**: Identify peak occupancy periods
3. **Bed Preference Analytics**: Track popular bed positions
4. **Occupancy Notifications**: Alert admins when rooms approach full capacity
5. **Waitlist Management**: Auto-waitlist when room becomes full
